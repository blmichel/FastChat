If you're applying for a different position, it might be better to ask for a recommendation from someone else. If you do decide to ask your friend for a recommendation, it's best to do it in person.

He was drinking a glass of water. I asked him if he was a poet. He said yes. I asked him what he wrote about. He said he wrote about his experiences. I asked him what his experiences were.

Thanks for any help. The article is on the latest development in the production of renewable bio-energy. The scientists at the University of Cambridge have discovered a way to make the process more efficient, by engineering a bacteria that can survive on a diet of nothing but the hydrogen from water. The ethical dilemma is that this process requires a lot of energy to begin with, and that it is not yet certain whether the bacteria would survive on their own in nature. Option 1: \"Bacteria to eat only hydrogen, could be the future of renewable energy\" Option 2: \"Bacteria to eat only hydrogen, could be the future of renewable energy, but has its drawbacks\" Option 3: \"Bacteria to eat only hydrogen, could be the future of renewable energy, but is not yet sure to be viable\" Option 4: \"Bacteria to eat only hydrogen, could be the future of renewable energy, but is not yet viable\" The article can be found here: 10.1038/nature10390 (2012).

The oxidation reaction is the one that is usually written in the balanced equation. The oxidation number of iodine increases from -1 to 0, and the oxidation number of hydrogen decreases from +1 to 0. The reduction reaction is the reverse of the oxidation reaction. The oxidation number of iodine decreases from 0 to -1, and the oxidation number of hydrogen increases from 0 to +1.

What is", "The advertising head of Zorblatt Animal Outlets is making a claim that the company should start advertising in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications. The claim is based on the fact that the company's two Zorblatt outlets in Harbor Town have recorded a consistent drop in sales during the past five years. The advertising head argues that this drop in sales is due to the fact that their rival, Aquatic Pavilion, has been advertising in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications for the past five years. The advertising head believes that if Zorblatt starts advertising in these publications, they will be able to reverse the trend of decreasing sales and return to profitability.\nTo evaluate this claim, we need to look at the evidence that the advertising head has provided. The advertising head has stated that the two Zorblatt outlets in Harbor Town have recorded a consistent drop in sales during the past five years. This is a clear indication that something is wrong with the company's sales strategy. However, the advertising head has not provided any evidence to support the claim that the drop in sales is due to the fact that Aquatic Pavilion has been advertising in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications. It is possible that there are other factors that are contributing to the drop in sales, such as a change in consumer preferences or a decline in the overall economy. To strengthen the claim, the advertising head should provide evidence that shows that Aquatic Pavilion's advertising campaign has been successful in increasing their sales. For example, the advertising head could provide data that shows that Aquatic Pavilion's sales have increased significantly since they started advertising in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications. Additionally, the advertising head should provide evidence that shows that Zorblatt's sales have decreased since they stopped advertising in these publications. This would show that the drop in sales is due to the lack of advertising, rather than any other factors. To weaken the claim, the advertising head should provide evidence that shows that Aquatic Pavilion's advertising campaign has not been successful in increasing their sales. For example, the advertising head could provide data that shows that Aquatic Pavilion's sales have not increased significantly since they started advertising in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications. Additionally, the advertising head should provide evidence that shows that Zorblatt's sales have not decreased since they stopped advertising in these publications. This would show that the drop in sales is not due to the lack of advertising, but rather due to other factors. In conclusion, the advertising head of Zorblatt Animal Outlets has made a claim that the company should start advertising in Rare Pets Digest and other popular animal publications. The claim is based on the fact that the company's two Zorblatt outlets in Harbor Town have recorded a consistent drop in sales during the past five years.
